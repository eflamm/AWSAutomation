The AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) enables development and documentation of AWS resources via text files.
To begin with, type  
`aws --version`   
at a command prompt. If the AWS CLI is installed and configured in the evironment path, the version number will be returned.
Compare the installed version number (if any) to the version listed in the [changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-cli/v2/CHANGELOG.rst)
To update your CLI, follow the instructions on the Install Page - be sure to check the instructions if moving from V1 to V2.
