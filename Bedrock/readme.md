# Working with Bedrock (AWS LLM Access)
[Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
[Model Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html)
In order to grant access to any of the Bedrock models, I had to switch to US-East-1 on my console. I'm not sure if this is the only region that allows access to the menu options which enable model access.
