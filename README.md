# AWSAutomation

My goal for this repo is to support 1 or more presentations I may develop about automating AWS. Topics may include:
1) Installing AWS CLI
2) Configuring AWS CLI
3) Interacting with S3 Resources
4) Interacting with Amazon Bedrock (LLM Services)
5) Working with Amazon Sagemaker (ML Services)
